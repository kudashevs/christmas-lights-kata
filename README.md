# Christmas Light Kata

A solution for the [Christmas Light Kata](https://kata-log.rocks/christmas-lights-kata) written in TypeScript. This solution
includes acceptance tests from the original kata. You can find the [original kata](https://adventofcode.com/2015) on the Advent of Code site
(a sixth assignment of the year 2015).

The repository has two branches:
- [master](https://github.com/kudashevs/christmas-lights-kata/tree/master) - the branch contains a simple solution (it uses an iteration to apply different methods to lights in the grid).
- [navigator_featured](https://github.com/kudashevs/christmas-lights-kata/tree/navigator_featured) - the branch contains a more complex solution (it uses a Navigator to perform the same operation).
